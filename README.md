# Henry

Henry is a simple static site generator written in Elixir. The name Henry refers to a certain famous doctor who may or may not have some association with static site generation.

**Henry is very much a work in progress**

## Why Henry

Henry was mostly made to help me learn Elixir and as motivation to rebuild my personal site. If you are already an Elixir developer, building stuff using `mix` tasks is pretty nice. Otherwise maybe you just feel like being a hipster and eschewing the popular static site generators. If looking for a mature solution to build stuff for your job, maybe check out https://www.staticgen.com/ first :)

## Roadmap

- [x] page parsing / rendering
- [x] multiple layouts

- [x] RSS feed generation
- [x] support images for posts
- [ ] build frontend assets

- [ ] themes from github
- [ ] Service worker generation

## Installation

Henry supports usage as a standalone script or usage via [mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html).

### Prebuilt
Check out the [releases](https://github.com/TheMallen/Henry/releases) tab for prebuild escript releases.

You will need erlang installed on your machine to run the escript distribution.

### Using mix

**Coming soon ;)**

### From source

#### Install Elixir
To build henry you will first need to install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

#### Clone the repo
We need to clone the repo before we can do much else.

```
git clone git@github.com:TheMallen/Henry.git
```

### Install dependencies
Next we fetch our dependencies, don't worry there's only a couple.

```
mix deps.get
```

### Build
In your local copy of the Henry repo

```
mix escript.build
```

This will generate an [escript](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/advanced/escripts/) in the directory named `henry`.

### Add henry to your path
Depending on your operating system and shell, the way you accomplish this will vary. If you're on Mac OS, check out [this stackexchange question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41542/adding-a-new-executable-to-the-path-environment-variable).

## Usage

** In depth docs coming soon **

### With mix

Once Henry is released to hex you will be able to use it as a dependency in mix projects.

### As an escript
```bash
  # bootstrap a project
  henry new "My Rad Website"
  cd ./my-rad-website
  # build the static files to /build
  henry build
```
